# Port-Traffic-Data-Analysis

## Introduction
The Port Traffic Analysis project offers a comprehensive Python script for examining and visualizing port traffic data. This tool is designed to facilitate insights into the dynamics of maritime movements, helping users identify patterns, peak activity periods, and trends within a specified time range.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading and Filtering:**
  The script reads port traffic data from a CSV file, allowing users to specify a date range for analysis.
  
- **Daily and Hourly Traffic Analysis:**
  Utilizing the Pandas library, the script provides an overview of daily and hourly traffic, highlighting the most active day and hour.

- **Visualization with Matplotlib:**
  Results are visually represented using Matplotlib, offering clear and intuitive graphs to better understand the data.

## Getting Started
To start exploring port traffic insights:
1. Install the required dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
2. Place your port traffic data CSV file in the `/kaggle/input/port-traffic-q3-2023/` directory.
3. Run the script in your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Notebook.

## File Structure
- `port_traffic_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script.
- `README.md`: Project overview, instructions, and details.
